  { quote: "The harvest is a business that has made me feel welcome and was quick to help me correct some errors. My daughter talked me into buying a bow so I could shoot with her I had never purchased a bow the only one I had ever owned was a recurve that was handed down to me. I did no research other than while I was standing in a big box chain store to compare the price and read a quick review of the bow the “archery pro” recommended. I purchased there and quickly discovered that when he set up the bow for me he set the draw length to short poorly set the peep sight and sent me on my way. Within a few weeks I had discovered through more research that I hadn’t made a wise decision and sought the assistance of the local pro shops close to me. Two much larger pro shops with big signs all but refused to help me simply because I did not purchase from them. Doc pointed me in the right direction on upgrading the rest with a drop away and upgrading the sights which I did. All of it done in a welcoming and friendly manner and treated me like I had been a life long customer instead of someone that stumbled upon their shop. Everyone there was friendly and helpful and educated me in a constructive way. In the very near future I will be upgrading my bow and there is only one place I will go and recommend and that is The Harvest.", sourceName: "Nathan T." },
  { quote: "I highly recommend Harvest Archery Pro Shop! I bought a bow elsewhere and quickly realized I knew nothing about bows. They were recommended by a friend so I went up and told Doc I didn't know what I am doing and needed help. He hooked me up with the right gear, taught me how to shoot and let me practice on his range. This level of customer service is rare these days. I'm a customer for life now.", sourceName: "John S." },
  { quote: "Made the drive from NW GA because I was having problems with tuning and he had it shooting straight within 20 minutes. Very knowledgeable and great people there!", sourceName: "Joey R." },
  { quote: "The guys here were all super friendly, very knowledgeable, and eager to help. Although I did not buy my bow here they still took good care of me and were more than willing to help set up my rest that another store installed improperly. 10/10 they have earned my business for life.", sourceName: "Wyatt D." },
  { quote: "The guys there were great. They set my bow up and helped me to get it tuned in. They were real cool. I would highly recommend this place. I'm new to archery, but they were patient with all my questions. Feel like I learned a lot today. Go see Doc!", sourceName: "Aaron T." },
  { quote: "Swung by the shop earlier today for my first lesson with Doc. It was awesome! I’m new to archery/bow hunting and want to build a foundation on good habits. I’m already seeing results in my consistency! Can’t wait for my next visit. Highly recommend!", sourceName: "Adam C." },
  { quote: "Such a great place! Folks here are super knowledgeable and kind.  They know their stuff, for sure.  They always take time to not only fix or adjust your bow, but also explain how to take care of things yourself, so you can be more confident with your shooting! And everybody loves Murphy!", sourceName: "Mary Ellen M." },
  { quote: "Great shop. Very knowledgeable. I couldn’t nail down my problem with my grouping and after a couple tweaks to my shoulder form I was back in business. Nice indoor range too.", sourceName: "Jared K." },
  { quote: "Purchased my first bow last week from Doc. My experience at Harvest Archery met every expectation and then some. Will always recommend Doc to others in the future!", sourceName: "Dakota G." },
  { quote: "My dear friend Doc. This...is an arrow you built for me two years ago. It [has] passed through 16 deer without ever having to be re-fletched. ... This arrow is a testament to your superb workmanship. Thank you very much Doc, I will have no one else touch my archery equipment. You are simply the best.", sourceName: "Richard B." },
  { quote: "I visited Harvest Archery Saturday. I have been doing my own bow work for the last 20 years. I picked up an Elite Ritual 35 in another state while I was traveling. Got home went to set it up and it was getting a holding weight of 66% which is completely wrong. No matter what I did I couldn't figure it out. Spent a week talking with Elite and a Tec. there to no avail. I was so frustrated while I was working on it, I forgot to put the limb stops back in, there for derailed the string. Long story short I handed the bow to Doc. He put the string back on and within seconds knew the bow had the wrong limb pads on it. Changed them out and I was good to go. If you’re looking for an Archery Shop Harvest Archery is the place to go. They are very knowledgeable, truly professional and just over all great people.", sourceName: "Jeff G." }
